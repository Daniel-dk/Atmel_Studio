Porting Arduino Due to Atmel studio and using SAM4S** instead of SAX3X
It can be used in place of the 32u4 , but with the memory and power of a Cortex-M3

The port to Atmel studio is so that we can use JTAG ( SAM-ICE ) and some of the 
other nice features of the IDE ( JTAG debugging and step into and out of code)

In the root of the Repo there are .atsln and .atsuo files, These are the 
Atmel Project files.

It uses the CMSIS bundled with Atmel Studio ( not the one that comes with Arduino )
but it uses the linker files that Ardfuino uses

I am using the SAM4S Xplained kit ( http://www.atmel.com/tools/sam4s-xpld.aspx ) 

USB Serial still does not work, the board runs blink just fine so clocks and digital IO are working as expected.
