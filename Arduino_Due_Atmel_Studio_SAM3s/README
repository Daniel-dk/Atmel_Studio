Porting Arduino Due to Atmel studio and using SAM3S4A instead of SAX3X
It can be used in place of the 32u4 , but with the memory and power of a Cortex-M3

The port to Atmel studio is so that we can use JTAG ( SAM-ICE ) and some of the 
other nice features of the IDE ( JTAG debugging and step into and out of code)

In the root of the Repo there are .atsln and .atsuo files, These are the 
Atmel Project files.

It uses the CMSIS bundled with Atmel Studio ( not the one that comes with Arduino )

TODO:
it builds ( compiles the .o ), but the linker reports "undefined reference to UDD_FifiByteCount"
and also to a few others from USBCore.cpp.

Thats where we are atm...
